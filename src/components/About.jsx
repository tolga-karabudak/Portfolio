        Hello! I'm a dedicated software test engineer with a strong background
        in software development. With proficiency in languages like TypeScript
        and JavaScript, I've worked extensively with various frameworks,
        including React, Node.js, and Three.js. I'm not only a developer but
        also a seasoned software tester, well-versed in testing tools such as
        Selenium, Cypress, TestNG, and Cucumber. My ability to learn quickly and
        collaborate closely with clients sets me apart. I specialize in crafting
        efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions that address real-world
        problems. In my current role as a software test engineer, I use my
        development expertise to enhance code quality and testing processes,
        ensuring that the software we deliver is seamless and reliable. Thank
        you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited to demonstrate how I can
        contribute to solving real-world challenges on your projects.
